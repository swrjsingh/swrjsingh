Hi, I'm Swaraj. I code a lot, experiment a lot, and read a lot of papers : ) I am currently working on interesting problems on compositionality of post training interventions. If I'm not experimenting with neural networks, you'll find me immersed in some novel side project I wish existed, hacking away at it with intense focus! I also enjoy Competitive Programming and dive into it whenever I find time : )
